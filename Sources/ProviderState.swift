// middot-joined fragments (amendment 20, overruling the concept's prose), and the
// calm normal state carries no banner message at all for either provider
// (amendment 19). The amendments also overrule the concept on: freshness <= 5 min
// (amendment 2), pip/dot severity (amendment 5), per-window inferred-zero with only
// the rolled ring dashed (amendment 9), and the age-based (not process-liveness)
// Codex forecast gate (amendment 2).
