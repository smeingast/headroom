<h1 align="center">Claude Usage</h1>

<p align="center">
  A tiny native macOS menu-bar app that shows your current Claude usage as
  <b>5-hour</b> and <b>weekly</b> utilization.
</p>

It reads the OAuth token Claude Code already stores in your login Keychain and
polls the same usage data that powers Claude Code's `/usage` command. No servers,
no accounts, no config files, no telemetry. It talks only to Anthropic.

## The dropdown

The menu opens with the same two rings the menu bar shows, drawn large: the
outer ring is the 5-hour window, the inner one the weekly window, with each
percentage and its reset time in both absolute and relative form ("resets
17:40 · in 3h 12m"). When the current pace would fill the 5-hour window before
it resets, a fainter arc extends the outer ring to the projected value; it
turns amber once the projection reaches 100%.

Below the graph, the app lists live Claude Code sessions on this Mac: a
busy/idle dot, the project name, the model family as a small chip, and the
context fill as a thin bar next to the exact token count. The bar is scaled to
the model family's advertised context window and is therefore approximate by
design; for model families the app does not recognize, only the count is
shown. Sessions are read from local files that Claude Code maintains for its
own purposes, so this section may break silently when the CLI changes its
internal layout.

## Display styles & color

Pick how the readout looks from the **Display Style** menu: concentric rings
(default; outer = 5-hour, inner = weekly), a single ring showing just the
5-hour window, percentages, or bars. The ring styles carry the forecast arc
described above; percentages and bars stay static. Earlier versions offered
four more styles (twin rings, gauges, pie slices, segments); these were
retired in v0.6 since they either duplicated the concentric information at
twice the width or lost resolution at menu-bar size, and a saved choice of a
retired style now falls back to concentric rings.

![Display styles](assets/styles.png)

The **Color** menu controls how usage maps to color:

- **Claude** (default): Anthropic's coral, tuned for light / dark menu bars; red ≥ 90 %
- **Monochrome**: adapts to the menu bar (light / dark)
- **Thresholds**: normal, orange ≥ 70 %, red ≥ 90 %
- **Heatmap**: green to red as usage climbs
- **System accent**: your macOS accent color

The dropdown panel follows the same choice: the header rings use the mode's
value colors, and the pills, session markers, and graph take coral for Claude,
your macOS accent for System accent, and neutral ink for the other modes,
which reserve color for warnings and data.

## Usage history & forecast

The dropdown draws an inline graph of past usage; hovering it shows exact
values and timestamps. In **Usage** mode with the 5h or 24h range, the time
axis extends past "now" to the end of the current 5-hour window, and the last
hour's fill rate is projected forward as a dotted line, drawn to the same time
scale as the history so its slope can be compared directly. When the pace
would reach 100% before the reset, the projection turns amber and a red dot
marks the crossing; the arc on the menu-bar rings shows the same projection.
The 7d and 30d ranges show history only, since five hours of look-ahead would
collapse into a few pixels at those scales. **Rate** mode instead plots how
fast each window was filling over time. Ranges and the mode switch sit as
pills directly above the graph; clicking them keeps the menu open.

The projection is a deliberately simple linear extrapolation of the last hour,
measured only within the current 5-hour window, and is best read as a lower
bound rather than a prediction. Samples are kept locally in a small
append-only file and trimmed after about a month, so nothing leaves your Mac.

## Requirements

- Apple Silicon Mac, macOS 13 (Ventura) or later.
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and
  **signed in**. That is what creates the Keychain item the app reads.

## Install

### Download (recommended)

Grab the latest **notarized** build from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/smeingast/claude-usage/releases/latest), unzip,
and drag **Claude Usage.app** to `/Applications`. It is signed with a Developer ID
and notarized by Apple, so it opens with no Gatekeeper warning.

### Build from source

Needs the Swift toolchain (Xcode, or Command Line Tools via `xcode-select --install`):

```sh
./build.sh              # build/Claude Usage.app  (ad-hoc signed)
./build.sh --install    # also copies to /Applications and clears quarantine
```

The result is a self-contained `.app` that uses only system frameworks. It is
deliberately light: one status item and a roughly 5-minute poll (plus an
on-demand refresh when you open the menu) with rate-limit backoff.

<details>
<summary><b>Maintainer: cutting a notarized release</b></summary>

With a **Developer ID Application** certificate installed, `build.sh` signs with a
hardened runtime automatically. To produce and zip the notarized, stapled `.app`:

```sh
./tools/notarize_setup.sh   # one-time: store Apple notary credentials in the keychain
./build.sh --notarize       # sign, submit to Apple, staple, verify
ditto -c -k --keepParent "build/Claude Usage.app" "build/Claude-Usage-vX.Y.zip"
```

`build.sh` does not bundle the versioned zip itself, hence the `ditto` step.
`notarize_setup.sh` needs an **app-specific password** (account.apple.com,
Sign-In and Security). Your Apple ID and Team ID live only in the keychain and
never touch the repo.
</details>

## First run

- **Keychain prompt: normally none.** The app reads the shared credentials the
  same way Claude Code itself does, which macOS allows silently. If macOS ever
  does ask (unusual setups), click **Always Allow** once.
- **Can't see it?** A menu-bar manager (Bartender, Ice, and similar) may be hiding
  it. Reveal the hidden section and ⌘-drag the item where you want it.

## How it works

| Piece | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Data source | `GET /api/oauth/usage`: `five_hour.utilization`, `seven_day.utilization` (plus model-specific weekly caps when in use) |
| Auth | OAuth token shared with Claude Code (Keychain service `Claude Code-credentials`), read silently and cached in memory. The token is refreshed only as a last resort and **never while any Claude Code process is running**: the refresh token is single-use, so spending it would log a live Claude Code out. While one runs, the app adopts whatever fresh token Claude Code writes |
| Active sessions | Live Claude Code sessions on this Mac (project, model, status, context tokens), read from `~/.claude/sessions/*.json` and each session's transcript tail. Local only, no network; undocumented internal state, so liable to change between CLI versions |
| Usage history | Past 5-hour and weekly utilization, sampled on each successful poll into an append-only file under Application Support and trimmed to about 32 days. Local only |
| Forecast | The last hour's fill rate, measured within the current 5-hour window and projected linearly to its reset. Drives the dotted graph projection and the arc on the ring glyphs; computed locally from the sampled history |
| Display | `NSStatusItem` rendered as text or a drawn glyph: 4 styles × 5 color modes |
| Footprint | Menu-bar only (`LSUIElement`); optional Dock icon; launch-at-login via `SMAppService` |
